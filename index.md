Machine learning has made staggering advances in the past decade, tackling problems that seemed uniquely human.
Most of this progress has remained locked behind formidable barriers of computing resources, applied only to staid and predictable business problems.

We believe that not only can machines think, they can dream. Hidden within these powerful engines of computation lies the key to creativity itself: conceptual understanding.
At *Dreaming Machines*, we’re working hard to put machine learning in the hands of artists so they can unlock this potential in ways that engineers never will.
Not as a toy or a gimmick, but as real first-class tools that will completely reshape the way you think about making art.

Hackable, accessible and open, we understand that you’re going to want to understand how your tools work and tweak them to fit your needs.
We aim to provide world-class support and education and care deeply about enabling and supporting all of the wonderful and bizarre innovations that our community can dream up.

### Product

Our first product, code-named *Wonder*, is a tool for exploring the conceptual spaces created by deep generative models.
These models map the probability distribution over the input space of the art provided by the user by compressing it into a powerful and expressive feature space.

Using this representation, you can move along the learned dimensions, combine pieces of art in meaningful, intuitive fashions, swap styles, or treat them as vectors that you can add, subtract and scale in order to reason by analogy.
Every time you do this, the machine dreams up a new rendition of these transformations, presenting a candidate for you to inspect, tweak, optimize and re-generate.

*Wonder* provides the framework needed for artists like you to leverage these tools to make real pieces of art.
Using smart segmentation technology, you can split your work into semantically meaningful chunks, operating on them independently or in your editor of choice before seamlessly merging them back together.
Our first priority is the experience of the non-technical power user: we aim to get out of your way without dumbing anything down.
*Wonder* should Just Work right out of the metaphorical box, but if you want to implement your own deep learning model in *TensorFlow* we’ll provide the tools to make that easy too.

### Keep in touch

If this is a tool you want to use, sign-up below and we’ll send you an invitation to our exclusive closed alpha when it's ready.
Our first push will focus on raster art, but we’re planning to expand into sound effects, vector art, music and more!
If there’s something you really want to see, shoot us a message on GitHub and we can explore the possibilities together.
